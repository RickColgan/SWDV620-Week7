        <h1><em>The Cuckoo's Egg</em> by Cliff Stoll</h1>
        <h2>Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage</h2>
        <p> <img class="imgleft" src="images/cover.jpg" width="168" height="278" border="0" alt="" /> <strong>Before the Internet became widely known as a global tool for terrorists, one perceptive U.S. citizen recognized its ominous potential. Armed with clear evidence of computer espionage, he began a highly personal quest to expose a hidden network of spies that threatened national security. But would the authorities back him up? Cliff Stoll's dramatic firsthand account is "a computer-age detective story, instantly fascinating [and] astonishingly gripping" (Smithsonian).</strong></p>
        <p>Cliff Stoll was an astronomer turned systems manager at Lawrence Berkeley Lab when a 75-cent accounting error alerted him to the presence of an unauthorized user on his system. The hacker's code name was "Hunter" -- a mysterious invader who managed to break into U.S. computer systems and steal sensitive military and security information. Stoll began a one-man hunt of his own: spying on the spy. It was a dangerous game of deception, broken codes, satellites, and missile bases -- a one-man sting operation that finally gained the attention of the CIA...and ultimately trapped an international spy ring fueled by cash, cocaine, and the KGB.</p>
        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <div class="boxright">
          <div class="boxrighttext"> Over the course of his investigation, Stoll contacted various agencies including the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/" target="_blank">FBI</a>, <a href="https://www.cia.gov/index.html" target="_blank">CIA</a>, <a href="https://www.nsa.gov/" target="_blank">NSA</a>, and <a href="https://www.osi.af.mil/" target="_blank">Air Force OSI</a>. </div>

        <p style="margin-right: 185px">Author Clifford Stoll, PhD, an astronomer by training, managed computers at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California. One day in 1986, his supervisor, Dave Cleveland, asked him to resolve a 75-cent accounting error in the computer usage accounts. Stoll traced the error to an unauthorized user who had apparently used nine seconds of computer time and not paid for it. Stoll eventually realized that the unauthorized user was a hacker who had acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superuser" target="_blank">Superuser</a> access to the LBNL system by exploiting a vulnerability in the movemail function of the original GNU Emacs.</p>
        <p>Early on, and over the course of a long weekend, Stoll rounded up fifty terminals, as well as teleprinters, mostly by "borrowing" them from the desks of co-workers away for the weekend. These he physically attached to the fifty incoming phone lines. When the hacker dialed in that weekend, Stoll located the phone line, which was coming from the Tynmet routing service. With the help of Tymnet, he eventually tracked the intrustion to a call center at MITRE, a defense contractor in McLean, Virginia. Over the next ten months, Stoll spent enormous amounts of time and effort tracking the hacker's origin. he saw that he hacker was using a 1200 baud connection and realized that the intrusion was coming through a telephone modem connection.</p>
